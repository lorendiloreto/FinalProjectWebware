Our group made GOATCONNECT: a linkedin-like service for WPI student athletes looking for jobs or internships. The goal of goatconnect is to connect current WPI student athletes with student athlete alumni who have graduated and want to offer jobs to WPI students who had a similar college experience to them. We plan to continue working on this project in our own time.

Currently, goatconnect allows for both students and alumni to make accounts after recieving a sign-up key from an administrator. Students can view and update their own information, while alumni can sign in and view current student athletes cards and reach out to them if they would like to offer them a job. instructions for signing in and creating accounts are below.

Premade sign in options:

|             | Student     | Alumni |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| email      | lorenade@milk.com  | harrison@apple.com |
| password | 1234 | 1234 |

To create an account, you can use one of the following sign up keys:

Student sign up key: ccc5d975-2e3a-473b-b91b-39841f196094

Alumni sign up key: 2f030b62-a697-4452-81d3-784b6282fd43
